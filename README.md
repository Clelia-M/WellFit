# WellFit Application

A web application that provides recipe ideas for vegetarian and gluten-free options, quick and easy to find options related to the user's dietary requirements. The user can include or exclude ingredients and select a cuisine of their choice. 

The Javascript code uses functions and event listeners to handle user interactions and update the content on the screen. Two APIs are used to retrieve dietry to work out calories per serving and video workout ideas. 

The two APIs used in this website: Caclories Burned by API-Ninjas and Youtube. 

This app has been created as a group project by Bex Ford, Clelia Mangione and Jingyue Zhao for the edEX Front-End Development Bootcamp.

## Caclories Burned by API-Ninjas (API)

The first API we created was from Spoonacular. Our website was created for users that are vegetarian with a gluten intolerance. Therefore the API request we created only displays food that are vegetarian and gluten free. With this API we also wanted the user to have the choice to include or exclude ingredients therefore we built it into the API request. We felt that this give the user more options to narrow down the recipe that they want to find, creating an overall better user experience. As you can see in the image below the options for the user:

## Youtube API 

The second API we created was Youtube. This enabled users to have a video link of vegeterian and gluten-free recipes. We felt this made the overall user experience great as all of the information was given without the user having to do a second search. As you can see in the image below the user has the option to click on **Watch on Youtube** button if they choose to do so.
