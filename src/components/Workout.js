      <h2>One Rep Max Calculator</h2>
      <h5>What is 1RM?</h5>
      <p>
        One rep max using the Epley formula. The Epley 1 Rep Max formula
        estimates how much the weight lifter could have lifted one time (RM)
        based on the maximum number of reps (r) of a lesser weight (w). This
        method is used in some competitions and in many gyms to avoid injuries
        and to provide a more consistent measure of endurance and strength. The
        Epley Formula for one repetition max is as follows: 1RM = Wâ€¢(1 + r/30){" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter the weight and reps to get the estimate of your 1RM (one-rep max).
        Your one-rep max is the max weight you can lift for a single repitition
        for a given exercise.
